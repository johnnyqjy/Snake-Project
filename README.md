# Snake-Project
Basing off the snake mini project, I have added the game score on the top left of the screen, sound effects after eating an apple/dying, and I have added bad apples to increase the difficulty(can be changed).  I have also loaded images for the apples and the snake for aesthetic purposes. One possible extension I was thinking about would be slowly increasing the number of bad apples as the game progresses (after 5,10,15 regular apples etc.).  Another extension would be gradually increasing the movement speed as the game progresses, so like going from 10 to 11,12,13 etc.
